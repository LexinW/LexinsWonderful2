Project for week 2, advanced css

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport



I started with html and css base files.
created a section for the header and the footer. 
Then I made the main section of the webpage where I have the sidebar and the different catagories of the resume. 
I only got to the first bit of the about me and the very beginning of structuring the webpage properly with CSS. 

I didn't allow myself enough time this week. I just didn't give myself anough time this previous weekend. Css is a timely process for my brain, I feel like I overcomplicate it. I'm loving javascript so far and have flown through all that stuff, I'll do a better job in the future :)

Here are the links with the work I did do:
